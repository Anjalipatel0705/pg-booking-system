Users can input a location in the search bar.
The list of PGs dynamically updates to show only those matching the entered location.

PG data (name, location, price, and image) is stored in an array in JavaScript.
The list of PGs is dynamically rendered on the webpage using JavaScript.
Interactive Booking:

Each PG card has a "Book Now" button.
Clicking the button triggers an alert message confirming the booking.
Responsive Design:

The webpage layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries.
